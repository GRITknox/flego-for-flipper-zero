# flego-for-flipper-zero
a bluetooth module for app controlled lego devices turning your flipper zero into a remote control.  
obviously very raw 
flego .fap is the zipped file to drop in your tools.
should probably have just done this one as a lua (or not at all)

nowhere near ready incase you came here to yell at me.
